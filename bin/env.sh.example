# If XFER_TARGET is not set, no transfer will be done

# Can run other sh commands
# For example, if need to load certain environment modules for compiled programs to run

# The following loads the requried modules to run on the GFDL workstations
. /usr/local/Modules/3.1.6/init/sh
module load intel_compilers/11.1.073
module load netcdf/4.2
module load ferret
